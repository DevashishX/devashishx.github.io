### These are my most notable Projects:
---   

1. **Scientific Research Papers clustering using Sentence Embedding**      
   **This is my bachelor's thesis. We are working on clustering research papers using their abstracts. We are using Sentence embeddings to get the clusterable vector representation.**    
   [GitHub](https://github.com/DevashishX/AbstractClustering "AbstractClustering") &ensp; 
   [Download Thesis Paper Draft](https://github.com/DevashishX/AbstractClustering/raw/master/drafts/paperdraft.pdf "paperdraft.pdf")

2. **Neural Machine Translation using Transformers**      
   **We used and tweaked fairseq translation models from facebook to implement English to German and English to French translation website. We experimented with training different models for neural machine translation. Comes with a server designed in Flask framework. Model framework is PyTorch.**

4. **Simple Stock Prediction using Regression**      
   **I attempted to predict the stock price of the next day using the data of previous days.**   
   [GitHub](https://github.com/DevashishX/stock_predict "stock_predict")


5. **Devtext - A text editor in C language using NCURSES**      
   **Devtext is a Text editor made with NCURSES library for Terminal UI. This project helped me  nderstand basic Data Structures and Algorithms and implement them. Devtext can open, save,  reate any new text file.**
