I am interested in Deep Learning - for Natural Language Processing, Controlling Amazon Web Services through Go and Python APIs and generalized clean code practices.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I love to paint landscapes using oil colors by using The Bob Rosss Technique. On the musical side,sometimes, I play Harmonium and Violin. I like to read Biographies, and fiction with deep underlying meaning.</strong></p>
