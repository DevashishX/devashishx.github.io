# About Me

Hi, I am Dev - a Master's student at RWTH Aachen, I am currently writing my thesis in Process Mining on logic driven and bias-free Anomaly Detection. I have worked for 2 years at Bosch in Abstatt and Stuttgart on measurement and optimization of (shared) memory occupied by critical real time software systems.

I am currently looking for full time jobs in Germany, so let's connect !
