### **Hi, I am Devashish! Nice to Meet you!**

**I started learning Scratch when I was in 5th grade and Python when I was in 7th grade, ever since, I have been fascinated by computers. I am interested in Deep Learning - for Natural Language Processing, Controlling Amazon Web Services through Go and Python APIs and generalized clean code practices.**

**I love to paint landscapes using oil colors by using The Bob Rosss Technique. On the musical side,sometimes, I play Harmonium and Violin. I like to read Biographies, and fiction with deep underlying meaning.**
